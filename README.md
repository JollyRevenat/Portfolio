## Charles Blake — Portfolio

This repository holds my personal portfolio site where I document projects from Bountiful High School and the Davis Catalyst Center, along with my outdoor-focused life at Snowbasin and BHS Lacrosse.

### Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS** for structure and styling.
- **Vanilla JS** for small enhancements (theme tokens, footer year).
- **Google Fonts / Space Grotesk** to keep typography consistent.

### Structure
- `index.html` — Landing page with hero, quick links, and nav.
- `about.html` — All background content (bio, skills, certifications, experience, timeline).
- `projects.html`, `resume.html`, `outdoors.html`, `contact.html`, `404.html`.
- `styles.css` and `script.js` handle styling and light interactivity.
